# reactProjectsNTenziGame
here are those projects which i use to learn the react in depth and i have prepared the learner.md files in which i have mentioned that what problems i faced and how i dealt with them and what are their fix .i also use commenting a lot so that if a absolute beginner came then he can also understand why i do this way not that way.
